# movie-club

**ARCHIVED** Movie Club had a good run, but as of 2019-11-30, it's been archived. So long, and thanks for all the fish!

## General

Yup, I belong to a movie club with my friends from work. Oh, and most of us are developers. So why are we drawing paper slips from a box to determine which movie we're going to watch next? Lame. This web-app is an attempt to remedy that.

## Questions? Issues? Feedback?

## Want to contribute?

Please feel free to fork and submit pull requests! Be warned though, @charwking is a bit OCD, so don't be surprised or offended if he merges your changes and then makes a bunch of changes of his own. :) Make sure you add your name to the contributors section below as part of your pull request!

## Run locally

Assuming you're on a mac...

* Make sure you've got `npm`, `git`, and `grunt-cli` installed:

## Firebase

This app currently uses [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) to handle authentication and data storage. If you run locally, you'll be connected to the dev firebase instance. Feel free to read/write whatever data you want from there.

If you're adding a feature and need admin access to that, talk to @charwking and he can set you up. Alternatively you could create your own firebase instance and point the app to it. The rules outlined in [FIREBASE.md](https://github.com/charwking/movie-club/blob/master/FIREBASE.md) should prove helpful.

If you need to make adjustments to the firebase rules, update the FIREBASE.md doc as part of your pull request and @charwking will update the PROD firebase instance when merging your changes in.
